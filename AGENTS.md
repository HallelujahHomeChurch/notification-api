# Repository Instructions

## Delivery Policy

- Treat `main` as the production branch. Do not commit or push directly to `main`.
- Create a focused branch for every task and submit changes through a pull request.
- CI must pass before merge. Do not bypass, ignore, or merge around a failing required check.
- Keep changes small and reviewable, and use squash merge unless the repository explicitly requires another strategy.
- For deployable applications and services, a merge to `main` is the release boundary: build an immutable artifact, deploy it through CI/CD, then verify health and the production route.
- Never deploy an unmerged local commit or replace the CI/CD path with an ad hoc production command.
- If deployment fails, preserve the last healthy revision, report the failure, and use the repository rollback path.
